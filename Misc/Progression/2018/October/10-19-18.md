## Binary Trees
* A binary tree is a tree with nodes that have references to two other nodes ```left```
and ```right```
* Python implementation:

```Python
class Tree:
  def __init__(self, cargo, left=None, right=None):
    self.cargo = cargo
    self.left = left
    self.right = right

  def __str___(self):
    return str(self.cargo)
```

* One way to build a tree is from the bottom up. Allocate the child nodes first

```Python
left = Tree(2)
left = Tree(4)

tree = Tree(1, left, right)
```

* Alternatively, we can nest the constructors

```python
tree = Tree(1, Tree(2), Tree(4))
```

## Traversing a tree
* Traversing a tree recursively:

```python
def traverse(tree):
  if (tree is None):
    return 0

  return traverse(tree.left) + traverse(tree.right) + tree.cargo
```

* Preorder traversal - the contents of ```root``` appears before the contents of
the ```children```

```python
def preorderTraversal(tree):
  if (tree is None):
    return

  print(tree.cargo, end=" ")
  preorderTraversal(tree.left)
  preorderTraversal(tree.right)
```

* Postorder traversal - the contents of ```children``` appears before the
contents of the ```root```

```python
def postorderTraversal(tree):
  if (tree is None):
    return

  postorderTraversal(tree.left)
  postorderTraversal(tree.right)
  print(tree.cargo, end=" ")
```

* Inorder traversal - the contents appear in the following order - left, root, right

```python
def inorderTraversal(tree):
  if (tree is None):
    return

  inorderTraversal(tree.left)
  print(tree.cargo, end=" ")
  inorderTraversal(tree.right)
```
