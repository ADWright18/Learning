## Python Looping Techniques
* When looping through dictionaries, the key and corresponding value can be
retrieved at the same time using the items() method.
* Example

```python
knights = {'gallahad' : 'the pure', 'robin' : 'the brave'}
for k, v in knights.items():
  print(k, v)

-> gallahad the pure
-> robin the brave
```

* When looping through a sequence, the position index and corresponding value
can be retrieved at the same time using the enumerate() function.
* Example:

```python
for i, v in enumerate(['tic', 'tac', 'toe']):
  print(i, v)

-> 0 tic
-> 1 tac
-> 2 toe
```

* To loop over two or more sequences at a time, the entries can be paired with
the zip() function
* Example:

```python
questions = ['name', 'quest', 'favorite color']
answers = ['lancelot', 'the holy grail', 'blue']
for q, a in zip(questions, answers):
  print("What is your {0}? It is {1}".format(q, a))

-> What is you name? It is lancelot.
-> What is your quest?  It is the holy grail.
-> What is your favorite color?  It is blue.
```
