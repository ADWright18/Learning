## Python List Comprehensions
* List comprehensions allow you to create lists based on certain conditions w/o
the need for control structures (i.e. if, for, while)
* Example:

```python
# Using control structure
squares = []
for x in range(10):
  squares.append(x**2)

# Using list comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

* Syntax: [(expression) for x in list (optional - control statement)]
* Example:

```python
# Generate all combinations of (x, y) tuple, where x does not equal y

[(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y]
-> [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]

# Equivalent to
combs = []
for x in [1,2,3]:
  for y in [3,1,4]:
    if (x != y):
      combs.append((x, y))
```

## Python Sets
* Sets are an unordered collection with no duplicate elements.
* Common Uses:
  * Membership testing
  * Eliminating duplicate entries

* Set objects support math operations like union, intersection, difference, and
symmetric difference
* Curly braces {} or the set() function can create sets
* Example:

```python
basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}
print(basket)
-> {'orange', 'banana', 'pear','apple'}
```
