## Python List Comprehensions
* List comprehensions allow you to create lists based on certain conditions w/o
the need for control structures (i.e. if, for, while)
* Example:

```python
# Using control structure
squares = []
for x in range(10):
  squares.append(x**2)

# Using list comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

* Syntax: [(expression) for x in list (optional - control statement)]
* Example:

```python
# Generate all combinations of (x, y) tuple, where x does not equal y

[(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y]
-> [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]

# Equivalent to
combs = []
for x in [1,2,3]:
  for y in [3,1,4]:
    if (x != y):
      combs.append((x, y))

combs
-> [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]
```

## Python Sets
* Sets are an unordered collection with no duplicate elements.
* Common Uses:
  * Membership testing
  * Eliminating duplicate entries

* Set objects support math operations like union, intersection, difference, and
symmetric difference
* Curly braces {} or the set() function can create sets
* Example:

```python
basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}

# Show that duplicated have been removed
print(basket)
-> {'orange', 'banana', 'pear','apple'}

# Fast Membership Testing
'orange' in basket
-> True

'crabgrass' in basket
-> False

# Demonstrate set operations
a = set('abracadabra')
b = set('alacazam')

# Unique letters in a
a
-> {'a', 'r', 'b', 'c', 'd'}

# letters in a but not in b (difference)
a - b
-> {'r', 'd', 'b'}

# letters in a or b or both (union)
a | b
-> {'a', 'c', 'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}

# letters in both a and b (intersection)
a & b
-> {'a', 'c'}

# letters in a or b, but not both (symmetric difference)
a ^ b
-> {'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}
```

* Just like lists, set comprehensions are also supported

```python
a = {x for x in 'abracadabra' if x not in 'abc'}
a
-> {'r', 'd'}
```

## Python Recursion
* Iterative Algorithm Example:

```python
houses = ["Eric's house", "Kenny's house", "Kyle's house", "Stan's house"]

def deliver_presents_iteratively():
  for house in houses:
    print("Delivering presents to", house)
```

* Recursive Algorithm Example:

```python
houses = ["Eric's house", "Kenny's house", "Kyle's house", "Stan's house"]

# Each function call represents an elf doing his work
def deliver_presents_recursively(houses):
  # Worker elf doing his work
  if len(houses) == 1:
    house = house[0]
    print("Delivering presents to", house)

  # Manager elf doing his work
  else:
    mid = len(houses) // 2
    first_half = houses[:mid]
    second_half = houses[mid:]

    # Divides his work among two elves
    deliver_presents_recursively(first_half)
    deliver_presents_recursively(second_half)
```
