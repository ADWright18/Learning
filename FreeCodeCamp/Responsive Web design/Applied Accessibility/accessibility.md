# Applied Accessibility
"Accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can
be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience.

## Objectives
* Have well-organized code that uses appropriate markup
* Ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content
* Create an easily-navigated page that's keyboard friendly

## Add a Text Alternative to Images for Visually Impaired Accessibility
* ```alt``` text describes the content of the image and provides a text-alternative
* This helps in case the image fails to load or can't be seen by a user.
* Good ```alt``` text is short but descriptive, and meant to briefly convey the
meaning of the message
* Example:

```html
<img src="doingKarateWow.jpeg" alt="Camper Cat Karate">
```

## Know When Alt Text Should be Left Blank
