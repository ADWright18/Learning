# Applied Visual Design

Applied Visual Design with CSS from freeCodeCamp

## Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property
* CSS has several options for how to align it with the ```text-align``` property
* ```text-align: justify;``` causes all lines of text except the last line to meet
the left and right edges of the line box.
* ```text-align: center;``` centers the text
* ```text-align: right;``` right-aligns the text
* ```text-align: left;``` (the default) left-aligns the text

## Adjust the Width of an Element Using the width Property
* You can specify the width of an element using ```width``` property in CSS
* Values can be given in relative length units (such as em), absolute length
units (such as px), or as a percentage of its containing parent element
* Example:

```css
img {
  width: 220px;
}
```

## Adjust the Height of an Element Using the height Property
* You can specify the height of an element using the ```height``` property in CSS,
similar to the ```width``` property.
* Example:

```css
img {
  height: 20px;
}
```

## Use the strong Tag to Make Text Bold
