# Applied Visual Design

Applied Visual Design with CSS from freeCodeCamp

## Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property
* CSS has several options for how to align it with the ```text-align``` property
* ```text-align: justify;``` causes all lines of text except the last line to meet
the left and right edges of the line box.
* ```text-align: center;``` centers the text
* ```text-align: right;``` right-aligns the text
* ```text-align: left;``` (the default) left-aligns the text
