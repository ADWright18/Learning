# The Modern Mode, "use strict"
* ```use strict``` explicitly enables modifications and new features available
to JavaScript

## "use strict"
* The directive looks like a string: ```"use strict"``` or ```'use strict'```.
When it is located on the top of the script, then the whole script works the
"modern" way
* Example:

```javascript
"use strict";

// this code works the modern way
```

* Note: Ensure that "use strict" is at the top
* Note: There's no way to cancel ```use strict```
